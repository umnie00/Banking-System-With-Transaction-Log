Project Title: 

      Banking System with Transaction Log

Project Description:

      This Banking System is a full-featured desktop application that provides:

      User Authentication: Secure login and registration system with role-based access (admin/user)
      Account Management: Users can deposit and withdraw funds with real-time balance updates
      Transaction History: Complete logging of all financial transactions
      Admin Dashboard: Advanced filtering and search capabilities for transaction monitoring
      AVL Tree Implementation: Efficient transaction filtering using self-balancing binary search trees
      Modern UI: Sleek, gradient-based interface with custom styling

For Users:

    View current balance
    Make deposits and withdrawals
    View personal transaction history
    Secure password-protected accounts

For Admins:

    View all system transactions
    Filter by transaction type (deposits/withdrawals)
    Filter by amount (greater than, less than, range)
    Search transactions by username
    View detailed account statistics
    Real-time performance metrics

--------------------------------------------

 Database:
 
The application uses SQLite for data persistence. The database file (banking_system.db) is automatically created on first run and stores:

User accounts with encrypted passwords
Transaction history
Account balances
Timestamps for all activities

Technical Details:

Framework: PyQt6 for GUI
Database: SQLite3
Data Structure: AVL Tree for efficient transaction filtering
Architecture: MVC-inspired pattern with separated concerns

Important Notes:

All monetary values are displayed with 2 decimal precision
Negative balances are prevented through validation
Admin accounts can view all transactions but cannot modify them
The system maintains complete transaction logs for auditing purposes
